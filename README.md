# ReactionFocusSim  
**Terminal-based Reaction Time and Focus Measurement Simulator**  

ReactionFocusSim is a lightweight console application developed in C++ using the Qt Creator IDE. It simulates a reaction time test where the user's response speed and focus are measured across multiple trials. The goal of the project is to provide an accessible and educational tool for experimenting with human-computer interaction, specifically in reaction-based input timing.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This simulator asks users to press the Enter key as soon as they see the “Now!” signal appear on the terminal. It repeats the test multiple times (10 rounds by default) and calculates the average reaction time at the end.

This application serves as:
- A basic reaction time measurement tool  
- A template for learning input timing and console interactions  
- A foundation for more advanced cognitive or embedded system experiments

## ✨ Features

- Terminal-based interaction (no external dependencies)  
- Accurate time measurement using high-resolution clocks  
- Randomized wait period before trigger signal  
- Multiple round analysis and average reaction time display  
- Simple and minimal code structure, ideal for beginners

## 🚀 Running the Project

1. **Open your Terminal (CMD).**  
2. Navigate to the folder containing the executable, for example:

   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\asus\Documents\ReactionFocusSim\build\Desktop_Qt_6_9_0_MinGW_64_bit-Debug
   
3. Run the application by typing:

   ReactionFocusSim.exe
